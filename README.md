# Heart Attack Prediction App

Welcome to the **Heart Attack Prediction** app! This application uses machine learning to predict the risk of heart attacks based on various health parameters. Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use platform for individuals to understand their health risks and take proactive steps to improve heart health.

## About

This app leverages **data science** and **machine learning** to predict the likelihood of a heart attack. By inputting health parameters such as age, heart rate, blood pressure, and more, users can get valuable insights into their heart health. The app uses a **predictive model** trained on a dataset to make these predictions.
